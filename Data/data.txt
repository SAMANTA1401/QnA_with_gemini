PyTorch Overview
Open -Source Deep Learning Library : Developed by Meta AI (formerly Facebook AI 
Research).•
Python & Torch : Combines Python’s ease of use with the efficiency of the Torch scientific 
computing framework, originally built with Lua. Torch was known for high -performance 
tensor -based operations, especially on GPUs.•
